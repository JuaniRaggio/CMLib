# Machine Learning Library

This is an educational project.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a machine learning library built with C from scratch


## What do we need?

- Math $\rightarrow$ Tensors $\rightarrow$ n-dimensional arrays
- Find Gradients $\rightarrow$ same as math's definition of gradient
- Compute gradients
- Adjust parameters

## What is a model?

It is a function who recieves inputs (numbers) and returns outputs (probabilities).
They have adjustable parameters $\theta \text{-parameters}$ and also a Cost function
$C(x, y, \theta) \rightarrow \text{Tells us how bad our model is}$. The goal is to minimize the cost function
